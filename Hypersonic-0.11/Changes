0.06    2026-01-28

        - Split out event loops
        - Split out http1 protocol
        - Add HTTP/2 support via nghttp2
        - Add some SSE support
        - Add Websockets (only v13 currently)
        - Some will know what we need next...

0.03    2026-01-26
        - Response
        - Request
        - TLS
        - Session
        - Compress

0.02    2025-01-26
        - Dynamic route support for real request handling
        - Path parameters (e.g., /users/:id) automatically extract values
        - Handlers receive $req hashref with method, path, body, id
        - Mixed static/dynamic routes in same server
        - Static routes still ~290K req/sec, dynamic routes call Perl per-request

0.01    2025-01-26
        - Initial release
        - JIT-compiled XS functions via XS::JIT (not Perl custom ops)
        - Handlers run once at compile time, full HTTP responses baked into C
        - Pure C event loop (kqueue on macOS/BSD, epoll on Linux)
        - ~290K requests/second on single core
        - Zero Perl in the hot path - recv/dispatch/send all in C
        - Support for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS
        - Keep-alive connection support
        - TCP_NODELAY for low latency
